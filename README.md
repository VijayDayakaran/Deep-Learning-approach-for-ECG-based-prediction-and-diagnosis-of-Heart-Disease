This project proposes a hybrid deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for the prediction and diagnosis of heart disease using ECG signals. The CNN component efficiently extracts critical features from ECG waveforms, while KNN classifies these features based on similarity to known patterns of heart health and disease.

Evaluated on a publicly available ECG dataset, the model achieves an impressive 97.32% accuracy, highlighting its potential as a non-invasive, accessible, and accurate tool for early heart disease detectionâ€”especially in areas with limited medical resources.
